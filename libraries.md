### EvoGym

EvoGym is a simulation platform for evolving the bodies and brains of soft robots-morphology and control. Robots are built from simple blocks called voxels, which can be rigid, soft, or actuated, hence enabling dynamic designs. EvoGym allows these robots to "learn" how to perform tasks like walking or carrying objects using algorithms inspired by evolution and reinforcement learning.

### SOFA 

[SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/) is an open-source framework designed for interactive mechanical simulations, with a strong focus on bio-mechanics and robotics. It provides advanced constitutive models and algorithms for efficiently computing both soft and rigid body dynamics. SOFA supports linear and non-linear elastic models, offers both explicit and implicit integration schemes, and includes traditional linear solvers. It integrates numerous algorithms and models, making it highly suitable for complex simulation needs in bio-mechanics and robotics.  [Compliance Robotics](https://compliance-robotics.com/) have developed a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI) for SOFA, tailored specifically for robotics applications. This open-source software enables you to control and program your robot with ease.

### SoftZoo
SoftZoo is a soft robot co-design platform for locomotion in diverse environments that supports an extensive, naturally-inspired material set, including the ability to simulate environments such as flat ground, desert, wetland, clay, ice, snow, shallow water, and ocean. SoftZoo provides a variety of tasks relevant for soft robotics, including fast locomotion, agile turning, and path following, as well as differentiable design representations for morphology and control.
With this platform, it is possible to use a wide variety of prevalent representations and co-design algorithms, including control optimization with differentiable physics and reinforcement learning, as well as co-design with evolutionary algorithms.

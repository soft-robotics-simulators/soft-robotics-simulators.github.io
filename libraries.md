### SOFA 

[SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/) is an open-source framework designed for interactive mechanical simulations, with a strong focus on bio-mechanics and robotics. It provides advanced constitutive models and algorithms for efficiently computing both soft and rigid body dynamics. SOFA supports linear and non-linear elastic models, offers both explicit and implicit integration schemes, and includes traditional linear solvers. It integrates numerous algorithms and models, making it highly suitable for complex simulation needs in bio-mechanics and robotics.  [Compliance Robotics](https://compliance-robotics.com/) have developed a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI) for SOFA, tailored specifically for robotics applications. This open-source software enables you to control and program your robot with ease.

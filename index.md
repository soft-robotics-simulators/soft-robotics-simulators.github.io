# About


The goal of this website is provide a centralized list of soft robotics simulators resources for developers and users alike.

# Resources

We provide the following resources:

* [Papers](https://soft-robotics-simulators.github.io/papers), a list of papers related to soft robotic simulators and their applications.  These papers can be easily added via a python script in our repository.
* [Workshop](https://soft-robotics-simulators.github.io/workshop), details on our RoboSoft 2025 Workshop/Tutorial/Hackathon
* [Libraries](https://soft-robotics-simulators.github.io/libraries), a curated list of known soft robotics simulators. If you would like to add a simulator to the list please submit a pull request or contact the main contributors.

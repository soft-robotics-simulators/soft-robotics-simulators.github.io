- abstract: 'Soft robots are notoriously hard to control. This is partly due to the

    scarcity of models able to capture their complex continuum mechanics, resulting

    in a lack of control methodologies that take full advantage of body compliance.

    Currently available simulation methods are either too computational demanding

    or overly simplistic in their physical assumptions, leading to a paucity of

    available simulation resources for developing such control schemes. To address

    this, we introduce Elastica, a free, open-source simulation environment for

    soft, slender rods that can bend, twist, shear and stretch. We demonstrate how

    Elastica can be coupled with five state-of-the-art reinforcement learning

    algorithms to successfully control a soft, compliant robotic arm and complete

    increasingly challenging tasks.'

- abstract: 'While significant research progress has been made in robot learning for

    control, unique challenges arise when simultaneously co-optimizing morphology.

    Existing work has typically been tailored for particular environments or

    representations. In order to more fully understand inherent design and

    performance tradeoffs and accelerate the development of new breeds of soft

    robots, a comprehensive virtual platform with well-established tasks,

    environments, and evaluation metrics is needed. In this work, we introduce

    SoftZoo, a soft robot co-design platform for locomotion in diverse

    environments. SoftZoo supports an extensive, naturally-inspired material set,

    including the ability to simulate environments such as flat ground, desert,

    wetland, clay, ice, snow, shallow water, and ocean. Further, it provides a

    variety of tasks relevant for soft robotics, including fast locomotion, agile

    turning, and path following, as well as differentiable design representations

    for morphology and control. Combined, these elements form a feature-rich

    platform for analysis and development of soft robot co-design algorithms. We

    benchmark prevalent representations and co-design algorithms, and shed light on

    1) the interplay between environment, morphology, and behavior; 2) the

    importance of design space representations; 3) the ambiguity in muscle

    formation and controller synthesis; and 4) the value of differentiable physics.

    We envision that SoftZoo will serve as a standard platform and template an

    approach toward the development of novel representations and algorithms for

    co-designing soft robots'' behavioral and morphological intelligence.'

- abstract: 'Accurate frictional contact is critical in simulating the assembly of

    rod-like structures in the practical world, such as knots, hairs, flagella, and

    more. Due to their high geometric nonlinearity and elasticity, rod-on-rod

    contact remains a challenging problem tackled by researchers in both

    computational mechanics and computer graphics. Typically, frictional contact is

    regarded as constraints for the equations of motions of a system. Such

    constraints are often computed independently at every time step in a dynamic

    simulation, thus slowing down the simulation and possibly introducing numerical

    convergence issues. This paper proposes a fully implicit penalty-based

    frictional contact method, Implicit Contact Model (IMC), that efficiently and

    robustly captures accurate frictional contact responses. We showcase our

    algorithm''s performance in achieving visually realistic results for the

    challenging and novel contact scenario of flagella bundling in fluid medium, a

    significant phenomenon in biology that motivates novel engineering applications

    in soft robotics. In addition to this, we offer a side-by-side comparison with

    Incremental Potential Contact (IPC), a state-of-the-art contact handling

    algorithm. We show that IMC possesses comparable performance to IPC while

    converging at a faster rate.'

- abstract: 'Voxel-based soft robots (VSRs) are aggregations of soft blocks whose
    design

    is amenable to optimization. We here present a software, 2D-VSR-Sim, for

    facilitating research concerning the optimization of VSRs body and brain. The

    software, written in Java, provides consistent interfaces for all the VSRs

    aspects suitable for optimization and considers by design the presence of

    sensing, i.e., the possibility of exploiting the feedback from the environment

    for controlling the VSR. We experimentally characterize, from a mechanical

    point of view, the VSRs that can be simulated with 2D-VSR-Sim and we discuss

    the computational burden of the simulation. Finally, we show how 2D-VSR-Sim can

    be used to repeat the experiments of significant previous studies and, in

    perspective, to provide experimental answers to a variety of research

    questions.'

- abstract: "When simulating soft robots, both their morphology and their controllers\
    \ play\nimportant roles in task performance. This paper introduces a new method\
    \ to\nco-evolve these two components in the same process. We do that by using\
    \ the\nhyperNEAT algorithm to generate two separate neural networks in one pass,\
    \ one\nresponsible for the design of the robot body structure and the other for\
    \ the\ncontrol of the robot.\n  The key difference between our method and most\
    \ existing approaches is that it\ndoes not treat the development of the morphology\
    \ and the controller as separate\nprocesses. Similar to nature, our method derives\
    \ both the \"brain\" and the\n\"body\" of an agent from a single genome and develops\
    \ them together. While our\napproach is more realistic and doesn't require an\
    \ arbitrary separation of\nprocesses during evolution, it also makes the problem\
    \ more complex because the\nsearch space for this single genome becomes larger\
    \ and any mutation to the\ngenome affects \"brain\" and the \"body\" at the same\
    \ time.\n  Additionally, we present a new speciation function that takes into\n\
    consideration both the genotypic distance, as is the standard for NEAT, and the\n\
    similarity between robot bodies. By using this function, agents with very\ndifferent\
    \ bodies are more likely to be in different species, this allows robots\nwith\
    \ different morphologies to have more specialized controllers since they\nwon't\
    \ crossover with other robots that are too different from them.\n  We evaluate\
    \ the presented methods on four tasks and observe that even if the\nsearch space\
    \ was larger, having a single genome makes the evolution process\nconverge faster\
    \ when compared to having separated genomes for body and control.\nThe agents\
    \ in our population also show morphologies with a high degree of\nregularity and\
    \ controllers capable of coordinating the voxels to produce the\nnecessary movements."

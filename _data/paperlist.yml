- abstract: 'Voxel-based soft robots (VSRs) are aggregations of soft blocks whose
    design

    is amenable to optimization. We here present a software, 2D-VSR-Sim, for

    facilitating research concerning the optimization of VSRs body and brain. The

    software, written in Java, provides consistent interfaces for all the VSRs

    aspects suitable for optimization and considers by design the presence of

    sensing, i.e., the possibility of exploiting the feedback from the environment

    for controlling the VSR. We experimentally characterize, from a mechanical

    point of view, the VSRs that can be simulated with 2D-VSR-Sim and we discuss

    the computational burden of the simulation. Finally, we show how 2D-VSR-Sim can

    be used to repeat the experiments of significant previous studies and, in

    perspective, to provide experimental answers to a variety of research

    questions.'

- abstract: "When simulating soft robots, both their morphology and their controllers\
    \ play\nimportant roles in task performance. This paper introduces a new method\
    \ to\nco-evolve these two components in the same process. We do that by using\
    \ the\nhyperNEAT algorithm to generate two separate neural networks in one pass,\
    \ one\nresponsible for the design of the robot body structure and the other for\
    \ the\ncontrol of the robot.\n  The key difference between our method and most\
    \ existing approaches is that it\ndoes not treat the development of the morphology\
    \ and the controller as separate\nprocesses. Similar to nature, our method derives\
    \ both the \"brain\" and the\n\"body\" of an agent from a single genome and develops\
    \ them together. While our\napproach is more realistic and doesn't require an\
    \ arbitrary separation of\nprocesses during evolution, it also makes the problem\
    \ more complex because the\nsearch space for this single genome becomes larger\
    \ and any mutation to the\ngenome affects \"brain\" and the \"body\" at the same\
    \ time.\n  Additionally, we present a new speciation function that takes into\n\
    consideration both the genotypic distance, as is the standard for NEAT, and the\n\
    similarity between robot bodies. By using this function, agents with very\ndifferent\
    \ bodies are more likely to be in different species, this allows robots\nwith\
    \ different morphologies to have more specialized controllers since they\nwon't\
    \ crossover with other robots that are too different from them.\n  We evaluate\
    \ the presented methods on four tasks and observe that even if the\nsearch space\
    \ was larger, having a single genome makes the evolution process\nconverge faster\
    \ when compared to having separated genomes for body and control.\nThe agents\
    \ in our population also show morphologies with a high degree of\nregularity and\
    \ controllers capable of coordinating the voxels to produce the\nnecessary movements."

- abstract: "When simulating soft robots, both their morphology and their controllers\
    \ play\nimportant roles in task performance. This paper introduces a new method\
    \ to\nco-evolve these two components in the same process. We do that by using\
    \ the\nhyperNEAT algorithm to generate two separate neural networks in one pass,\
    \ one\nresponsible for the design of the robot body structure and the other for\
    \ the\ncontrol of the robot.\n  The key difference between our method and most\
    \ existing approaches is that it\ndoes not treat the development of the morphology\
    \ and the controller as separate\nprocesses. Similar to nature, our method derives\
    \ both the \"brain\" and the\n\"body\" of an agent from a single genome and develops\
    \ them together. While our\napproach is more realistic and doesn't require an\
    \ arbitrary separation of\nprocesses during evolution, it also makes the problem\
    \ more complex because the\nsearch space for this single genome becomes larger\
    \ and any mutation to the\ngenome affects \"brain\" and the \"body\" at the same\
    \ time.\n  Additionally, we present a new speciation function that takes into\n\
    consideration both the genotypic distance, as is the standard for NEAT, and the\n\
    similarity between robot bodies. By using this function, agents with very\ndifferent\
    \ bodies are more likely to be in different species, this allows robots\nwith\
    \ different morphologies to have more specialized controllers since they\nwon't\
    \ crossover with other robots that are too different from them.\n  We evaluate\
    \ the presented methods on four tasks and observe that even if the\nsearch space\
    \ was larger, having a single genome makes the evolution process\nconverge faster\
    \ when compared to having separated genomes for body and control.\nThe agents\
    \ in our population also show morphologies with a high degree of\nregularity and\
    \ controllers capable of coordinating the voxels to produce the\nnecessary movements."
